# Project Overview

## Project Name

wrapper

## Project Description

wrapper is an airtable and React base app that will allow users to discuss, learn about, and discover new cigars. Cigar culture is historically a bit snobby, so this app will endeavor to make cigars more accesible to the beginner, while also providing a useful service to the purists. It will allow users to post reviews of cigars, add tasting notes, revisit past reviews (and update them), and search the database for specific reviews based on cigar name or by author.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I know how to set up and make the majority of the app functional and appealing to users. I have a pretty good idea of what I want it to look like and the logic behind the functionality that I want to impliment for this project. I'm pretty strong on the logic side of React.

### Weaknesses:

I am not 100% clear how I am going to make my search and top cigar (based on rating) functionality work. In addition, class components are still pretty fresh, and it is going to be difficult to impliment them in the project per the requirements. Lastly, I am still not completely confident with CSS, so making the project look how it does in my mind is going to be an adventure to Mt. Doom.

### Opportunities:

This project will allow me to practice all the the React syntax and logic that I have learned in the last two weeks, and give me a concrete example of how far I have come. It will also give me the opportunity to learn some new things that I haven't learned yet.

### Threats:

I get hung up with a lot of the React errors and get frustrated, causing me to lose confidence in myself and what I know is the correct way to impliment something. I know I am going to encounter these errors, so I am going to have to keep this in mind and ask for help if I really fall down into the pit of dispair.
